% function [indices,dists]=findknn(xTr,xTe,k);
%
% Finds the k nearest neighbors of xTe in xTr.
%
% Input:
% xTr = dxn input matrix with n column-vectors of dimensionality d
% xTe = dxm input matrix with n column-vectors of dimensionality d
% k = number of nearest neighbors to be found
% 
% Output:
% indices = kxm matrix, where indices(i,j) is the i^th nearest neighbor of xTe(:,j)
% dists = Euclidean distances to the respective nearest neighbors
%
